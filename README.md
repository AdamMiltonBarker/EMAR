# Introduction
COVID-19 Robotics Emergency Assistance is a robotics/AI & IoT research and development project. The goal is to create an open source, voice controlled/tele-operated robot prototype. The prototype will be capable of taking temperatures, adjusting breathing and medical apparatus, administering drugs and other light activities that can reduce the amount of time doctors and other medical staff are in contact with COVID-19, and potential COVID-19 patients.

There will be multiple prototypes as we plan out the development of the final design, and we are in the early stages of preparing, but hope to take this prototype to a level capable of handling, and being used in the COVID-19 pandemic, or similar events we may face in the future.
